# Financial-Forecasting-Project
# 💹 Financial Forecasting Project

## 📌 Overview

This project uses historical financial data to build predictive models for future forecasting. Accurate forecasting enables organizations to make informed strategic decisions, manage budgets effectively, and anticipate market trends.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Preprocess and analyze historical financial data
- Explore trends, seasonality, and outliers
- Build and evaluate forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM)
- Visualize future predictions

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes:
- Date/time index (monthly or daily)
- Financial metrics (e.g., revenue, expenses, profit, etc.)

Data Source: `financial_data.csv`

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- `pandas`, `numpy`
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – visualization
- `scikit-learn` – machine learning
- `statsmodels` – ARIMA
- `fbprophet` or `NeuralProphet` – time series forecasting
- `keras`, `tensorflow` – LSTM (optional)

## ⚙️ Steps

1. Data Preprocessing
   - Handle missing values
   - Ensure correct datetime format
   - Resample to monthly/quarterly if needed

2. Exploratory Data Analysis
   - Trend analysis
   - Seasonality and cyclic patterns
   - Correlation with other metrics

3. Modeling
   - ARIMA/SARIMA for classical time series
   - Facebook Prophet for quick forecasting
   - LSTM for deep learning-based time series

4. Model Evaluation
   - RMSE, MAE, MAPE metrics
   - Visual comparison with actual data

5. Forecast Visualization
   - Plot predicted vs actual
   - Forecast for next 6–12 months

## 📈 Results

The final model provides forecasts that capture seasonal patterns and major trends with an acceptable margin of error, helping stakeholders make data-informed decisions.
